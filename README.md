# pdd_kaggle_titanic
This is a code repository for my submissions for the [Titanic-Machine Learning From Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

The code scripts are generated by the [Prompt-Driven Development (PDD)](https://github.com/promptdriven/pdd) application developed by [PromptDriven.ai](https://promptdriven.ai/).

## Project Structure
The project repository contains the following subfolders: 
- ```./inputs``` which includes the training, testing and sample output datasets formatted as .csv file
- ```./src``` which includes all code scripts
- ```./prompts``` which includes sample prompt files I created for the PDD model
- ```./outputs``` which is the default folder for testing output files.
  
Users might create other subfolders (e.g. ```./docs```) for formatted report and documentation storage.

## Prerequisites
To utilize PDD to generate code solutions, refer to [the original PDD repo](https://github.com/promptdriven/pdd) to configure and run the model.

To run the code scripts in this repo directly, first make sure that Python>=3.12 and pip are installed. Then download the following prerequisites in Linux, Bash or PowerShell:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

Creating a virtual environment before downloading prerequisites is recommended.

## Run
To run any standalone scripts, input the following command in Linux, Bash or PowerShell:

```
python src/<filename>.py
```
